Don't worry, you're not alone! This is the mildly anonymous public repository for Madeleine. So far we have uploads for Assignment 1 of the University of Auckland course STATS 220 - Data Technologies Semester 1 2022, where I have developing R skills to transform images in ways like never before. Here I am hosting the journey of my very first meme despite being born in the 80s.

You can view my efforts as a baby meme maker [here](https://madeleine-universe.github.io/stats220/index.html) where I have transformed three images and layered them to produce an original light hearted *meta* meme.

Thank you Anna Fergusson (Course Legend aka Coordinator & Teacher) for helping me see the light.
